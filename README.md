# üß† FinBrains: AI-Powered Personal Finance Assistant

## üöÄ Project Overview

**FinBrains** is an intelligent personal finance management application designed to give users granular control over their spending, budgeting, and financial goals. Built with a modern microservices architecture, this project leverages **Spring Boot** for a robust backend and integrates with **Machine Learning** to provide automated expense categorization and proactive financial insights.

This project serves as a final-year demonstration of proficiency in scalable backend development, database design, and real-world AI integration patterns.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Design

The system employs a **Layered Architecture** with a clear separation of concerns, built for extensibility:

1.  **Controller Layer:** Handles HTTP requests, JWT token validation, and request mapping.
2.  **Service Layer:** Contains the core business logic (CRUD operations, data validation, and AI integration calls).
3.  **Repository Layer:** Interfaces directly with MongoDB for data persistence and retrieval.

**Database Schema:**
The MongoDB schema is designed for performance and flexibility, utilizing **embedded documents** (`Users,Category,`Budgets`) to minimize joins and optimize data retrieval for the end-user.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Local Development

### Prerequisites

* JDK 17+
* Maven 3.6+
* Docker (Optional, for running MongoDB locally)

### 1. Database Setup

1.  Ensure **MongoDB** is running locally (e.g., via Docker):
    ```bash
    docker run --name finbrains-mongo -p 27017:27017 -d mongo
    ```

### 2. Backend Configuration

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [Your-Repo-URL]
    cd FinBrains
    ```
2.  Update `application.properties` with your MongoDB connection string:
    ```properties
    spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://localhost:27017/finance_assistant_db
    # ... other properties
    ```
3.  Build and run the Spring Boot application:
    ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```

The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

## üìû API Endpoints (Current Implementation)

All endpoints are secured and require a valid JWT in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

| Feature | Method | Endpoint | Request Body (DTO) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Sign Up** | `POST` | `/api/v1/auth/signup` | `UserRequest` |
| **User Log In** | `POST` | `/api/v1/auth/login` | `LoginRequest` |
| **Add Expense** | `POST` | `/api/v1/expenses` | `ExpenseRequest` |
| **Get All Expenses**| `GET` | `/api/v1/expenses` | None |
| **Update Expense** | `PUT` | `/api/v1/expenses/{id}`| `ExpenseRequest` |
| **Delete Expense** | `DELETE`| `/api/v1/expenses/{id}`| None |

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Future Enhancements

* Complete Python **ML Microservice** integration for category and anomaly prediction.
* Implement real-time **WebSockets** for budget alerts.
* Develop the **React.js** frontend (Web Application Interface).
* Add comprehensive Unit and Integration testing using JUnit and Mockito.
